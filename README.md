Project Description:

Undergraduate directed studies looking at the effects of short-term heat waves on the giant green anemone *Anthopleura xanthogrammica*. All lab and field work was completed at the Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre in Bamfield, BC. 

This repositroy includes datasets and working files for analysis on experiments and observations made at the Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre. All code is still in the process of being written and organized. Initial_Data_Analysis contains the rough initial analysis of all data, including code that will not be used in analyses for the paper. Data_Analysis_V2 is a more concise and organized version of Initial_Data_Analysis that will be added to as code is agreed upon by both authors.
